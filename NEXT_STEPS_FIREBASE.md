# üéâ Repository Created Successfully!

Your SnipVault repository is now live at: https://github.com/gaelican/snipvault

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps:
1. ‚úì Repository created on GitHub
2. ‚úì Code pushed to main branch
3. ‚úì GitHub Actions workflows ready

## üî• Firebase Setup Required

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Name it: `snipvault` (or similar)
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional)
5. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Enable Firebase Services

In your Firebase project:

1. **Authentication**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Get started
   - Enable Email/Password provider
   - (Optional) Enable Google provider
   - (Optional) Enable GitHub provider

2. **Firestore Database**
   - Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Create database
   - Start in production mode
   - Choose your region (closest to you)
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Firebase Hosting**
   - Go to Hosting ‚Üí Get started
   - Skip the setup steps (we'll deploy via GitHub Actions)

### Step 3: Get Firebase Configuration

1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
2. Under "Your apps", click "Web" icon (</>)
3. Register app with nickname "SnipVault"
4. Copy the configuration object

### Step 4: Generate Service Account

1. Still in Project Settings
2. Go to "Service accounts" tab
3. Click "Generate new private key"
4. Save the downloaded JSON file
5. Convert to base64:
   ```bash
   # If you have the file locally:
   base64 < service-account.json | tr -d '\n' > service-account-base64.txt
   ```

### Step 5: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to https://github.com/gaelican/snipvault/settings/secrets/actions

Click "New repository secret" for each:

**Required Secrets:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` - From Firebase config
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - From Firebase config
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - From Firebase config
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - From Firebase config
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - From Firebase config
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` - From Firebase config
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Base64 encoded service account JSON
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Your project ID (again, for admin)
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - From service account JSON
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` - From service account JSON (keep the \n characters)

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI features (get from https://platform.openai.com)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payments (get from https://stripe.com)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe publishable key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For Stripe webhooks

### Step 6: Deploy Security Rules

Once secrets are added, the GitHub Action will run automatically. After the first deployment:

1. Install Firebase CLI locally (on a computer):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   ```

2. Clone your repo and deploy rules:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaelican/snipvault
   cd snipvault
   firebase use YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
   ```

## üöÄ Monitor Deployment

1. Go to https://github.com/gaelican/snipvault/actions
2. Watch the "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" workflow
3. Once complete, your app will be live at:
   - `https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.web.app`
   - `https://YOUR-PROJECT-ID.firebaseapp.com`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If the build fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure all secrets are set correctly
3. Make sure Firebase project exists

### Common issues:
- Missing secrets: Double-check all required secrets are added
- Invalid service account: Regenerate and re-encode
- Firebase not initialized: Make sure project is created

## üì± Local Development

To work on the project locally (outside Termux):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaelican/snipvault
cd snipvault
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Firebase config
npm run dev
```

## üéä Success!

Once all steps are complete:
- Your app will auto-deploy on every push to main
- CI/CD pipeline will ensure code quality
- Firebase will handle all backend services
- You'll have a production-ready snippet manager!
